"""
Test script to demonstrate the Parakeet transcription provider.

This script provides a basic example of how to initialize and test the Parakeet
ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) provider from the transcription framework.

Usage:
    python examples/test_parakeet.py

Requirements:
    - PyTorch and torchaudio installed
    - Parakeet provider properly configured
    - CUDA-capable GPU recommended (but not required)

What This Script Does:
    1. Generates a synthetic audio file (440 Hz sine wave tone)
    2. Initializes the Parakeet transcription provider
    3. Performs a health check to verify the provider is working
    4. Demonstrates provider capabilities and features
    5. Cleans up temporary files

Note:
    This is a demonstration script that generates synthetic audio (sine wave tone)
    rather than actual speech. For real transcription testing, replace the
    create_test_audio() function with actual speech audio files.

Expected Output:
    - Provider initialization confirmation
    - Health check status (should be healthy)
    - Supported features list
    - Test audio file path

    Create a synthetic test audio file for demonstration purposes.

    Generates a 3-second mono audio file containing a 440 Hz sine wave (A4 note)
    with added Gaussian noise. The audio is saved as a temporary WAV file.

    Returns:
        Path: Absolute path to the generated temporary WAV file.

    Technical Details:
        - Sample Rate: 16000 Hz (standard for speech recognition)
        - Duration: 3 seconds
        - Frequency: 440 Hz (A4 musical note)
        - Channels: 1 (mono)
        - Noise: Gaussian noise at 10% amplitude for realism

    Note:
        This generates a pure tone, not speech. It's intended for testing
        provider initialization and health checks, not actual transcription
        quality. The caller is responsible for deleting the temporary file.

    Main test function to demonstrate Parakeet provider functionality.

    This function orchestrates the complete test workflow:
    1. Creates a synthetic audio file for testing
    2. Initializes the Parakeet transcription provider via the factory
    3. Retrieves and displays provider metadata (name, features)
    4. Performs a health check to verify provider readiness
    5. Cleans up temporary files when done

    The test validates that the provider can be initialized and is operational,
    but does not perform actual transcription since the audio is a synthetic
    tone rather than speech.

    Raises:
        Exception: If provider creation or health check fails.

    Note:
        Temporary audio files are automatically cleaned up in the finally block,
        even if an error occurs during testing.
