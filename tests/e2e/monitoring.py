"""
Monitoring and Reporting Module for E2E Testing.

This module provides comprehensive test execution monitoring, performance tracking,
and reporting capabilities for end-to-end testing workflows. It stores metrics in
a SQLite database and generates reports in multiple formats (HTML, JSON, Markdown).

Key Features:
    - Test execution monitoring with detailed metrics
    - Performance metrics collection (execution time, memory, CPU)
    - Multi-format report generation (HTML, JSON, Markdown)
    - Historical trend analysis and performance tracking
    - Automated alert system for failures and degradation
    - Integration points for external monitoring systems

Database Schema:
    The module creates two main tables:
    - test_metrics: Individual test execution data
    - suite_metrics: Aggregated test suite statistics

    Indexes are created on timestamp and suite_name for efficient queries.

Usage Example:
    >>> from pathlib import Path
    >>> metrics_collector = TestMetricsCollector(Path("metrics.db"))
    >>> report_generator = ReportGenerator(metrics_collector)
    >>> alert_system = AlertSystem(metrics_collector)
    >>>
    >>> # Record metrics
    >>> suite_metrics = SuiteMetrics(...)
    >>> metrics_collector.record_suite_metrics(suite_metrics)
    >>>
    >>> # Generate reports
    >>> report_generator.generate_html_report(Path("report.html"))
    >>> alert_system.check_and_send_alerts("suite_name", suite_metrics)

            alert: Dictionary with 'level' (critical/warning) and 'message' keys

        Integration Points:
            To add notification channels, extend this method with:
            - Slack webhooks (slack_sdk)
            - Email (SMTP)
            - PagerDuty API
            - Discord webhooks
            - Microsoft Teams
            - Custom monitoring systems

        Example Integration:
            >>> # Add to this method:
            >>> import requests
            >>> if alert['level'] == 'critical':
            >>>     requests.post(SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, json={'text': alert['message']})

# Example usage and integration function
def monitor_test_execution(test_results: Dict, output_dir: Path):
    """
    Monitor test execution and generate comprehensive reports.

    This is a convenience function demonstrating the complete workflow
    for integrating the monitoring system into a test suite. It handles
    metrics collection, alert checking, and multi-format report generation.

    Args:
        test_results: Dictionary mapping suite names to result dictionaries.
            Each result dict should contain:
                - 'total': Total number of tests (int)
                - 'passed': Number of passed tests (int)
                - 'failed': Number of failed tests (int)
                - 'skipped': Number of skipped tests (int)
                - 'duration': Total execution time in seconds (float)
                - 'avg_time': Average test execution time (float)
                - 'success_rate': Success rate percentage (float)
                - 'coverage': Optional code coverage percentage (float)

        output_dir: Directory path where reports and database will be saved

    Returns:
        Tuple of (metrics_collector, report_generator) for further use

    Example:
        >>> test_results = {
        ...     'auth_tests': {
        ...         'total': 10, 'passed': 9, 'failed': 1, 'skipped': 0,
        ...         'duration': 15.3, 'avg_time': 1.53, 'success_rate': 90.0
        ...     },
        ...     'api_tests': {
        ...         'total': 25, 'passed': 25, 'failed': 0, 'skipped': 0,
        ...         'duration': 42.7, 'avg_time': 1.71, 'success_rate': 100.0

        >>> collector, generator = monitor_test_execution(
        ...     test_results, Path("./test_output")
        ... )

    Side Effects:
        - Creates SQLite database at output_dir/test_metrics.db
        - Generates test_report.html in output_dir
        - Generates test_report.json in output_dir
        - Generates test_report.md in output_dir
        - Logs alerts if thresholds exceeded
