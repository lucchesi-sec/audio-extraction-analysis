"""Test suite for audio extraction service.

This module provides comprehensive unit tests for the audio extraction functionality,
covering:
- AudioQuality enum validation
- AudioExtractor class initialization and FFmpeg dependency checks
- Audio extraction with various quality presets (HIGH, STANDARD, SPEECH, COMPRESSED)
- Video file information retrieval
- Error handling for missing files, FFmpeg failures, and invalid inputs
- Path validation for filenames with special characters
- Legacy extract_audio() function for backward compatibility

All tests use mocked subprocess calls to avoid dependency on actual FFmpeg installation
and to ensure fast, isolated test execution.
