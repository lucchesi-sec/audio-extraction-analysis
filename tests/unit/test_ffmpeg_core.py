"""Unit tests for ffmpeg_core.py - FFmpeg command construction.

Tests cover:
- Base command construction
- All quality presets (SPEECH, STANDARD, HIGH, COMPRESSED)
- Two-step SPEECH pipeline (extract + normalize)
- Path handling with spaces and special characters
- Command injection prevention
- -y flag presence to prevent hangs
