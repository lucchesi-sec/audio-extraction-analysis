"""
Verification script for Deepgram streaming upload implementation.

This script verifies that the DeepgramTranscriber implementation correctly uses
file handle streaming instead of loading entire audio files into memory. This is
critical for handling large audio files without exhausting system memory.

Purpose:
    - Verify that _open_audio_file returns a file handle (not bytes)
    - Confirm _submit_transcription_job accepts audio_source parameter
    - Validate proper context manager usage for resource cleanup
    - Demonstrate memory efficiency: O(1) vs O(file_size)

The verification uses mocking to avoid external dependencies and performs static
analysis of the implementation to ensure streaming behavior is maintained.

Usage:
    python verify_streaming.py

Exit Codes:
    0 - All verifications passed
    1 - Verification failed or error occurred

def verify_streaming_implementation() -> None:
    """
    Verify that the DeepgramTranscriber implementation uses file handle streaming.

    This function performs comprehensive verification of the streaming implementation
    by testing four critical aspects:

    1. File Handle Creation: Confirms _open_audio_file returns a file handle object
       (io.BufferedReader) rather than reading file contents into memory.

    2. Method Signature: Validates that _submit_transcription_job accepts an
       audio_source parameter for receiving file handles.

    3. Memory Efficiency: Demonstrates the improvement from O(file_size) memory
       usage (old implementation) to O(1) constant memory usage (new implementation).

    4. Context Manager Usage: Ensures proper resource cleanup by verifying the
       implementation uses 'with' statements for file handle management.

    The function uses mocking to isolate the DeepgramTranscriber from external
    dependencies (API keys, network calls) and performs static source analysis
    to verify implementation details.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If any verification step fails, indicating the streaming
            implementation is not correctly configured.
        ImportError: If required modules (src.providers.deepgram, etc.) cannot
            be imported.
        Exception: For unexpected errors during verification (e.g., file access
            issues, inspection failures).

    Returns:
        None: Prints verification results to stdout and exits via sys.exit().
